Just a small task to provision a Proxmox LXC container joined to FreeIPA.

Typical Playbook usage:

---
- hosts: <promox host>
  tasks:
    - include_role:
        name: create-proxmox-centos7-ipa
      vars:
        hostname: <hostname>
        vmid: "{{ hostvars['<hostname>']['proxmox_vmid'] }}"
        root_password: "{{ hostvars['<hostname>']['root_password'] }}"
        ipa_domain: "{{ ipa_domain_name }}"
        ipa_username: admin
        ipa_password: "{{ ipa_admin_password }}"
        centos_version: 8  # 7 is the default

I keep IPA data on group_vars/all/(vars|vault) and proxmox_vmid/root_password on
host_vars/<host>/(vars|vault).

I only need a single line in the inventory for each host's hostname, and I put:

ansible_become: True
ansible_user: <my ipa username>

in the host's variables to connect.

I use DHCP/DNS so IP configuration is automatic and I can access the containers
using their hostname.

You can use extra vars such as memory/swap to set up memory and swap allocation
and extra_opts for extra options for pct_create.

You can use an "unprivileged" boolean parameter to create an unprivileged container
(with some Docker support), but at the moment this is not recommended due to:
